# üìú Webetu Progres (API Docs) {Unofficial}
The goal of this repository is to do an analysis of how the webetu progress app works, and try to document its corresponding backend API

**NOTE:**
- This repository is unofficial and is not always up to date with the official API
- This repository was only made for educational purposes
- The documentation may not cover all endpoints or can lack type definitions due to empty server responses
- Using the api from a browser requires setting up a proxy server to bypass CORS limitations. an example proxy implementation is integrated into the docs app to make swagger UI work

# üíª Tech stack

The project uses nestjs's openAPI capabilities to generate a typed openAPI schema
which can be used in the swagger UI or to generate Postman docs. In addition it can be used to generate a typed api client in frontend apps
